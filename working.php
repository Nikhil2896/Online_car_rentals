		<h3 class="ml-5 mb-5">On-demand transportation technology is our core service, and the app that connects driver-partners and riders is what makes it all possible. Hereâ€™s how it works, step by step:</h3>
		<div class="mx-auto" style="width: 50%">
			<h4>Step 1 : The rider search for the car</h4>
			<h5 class="mb-5">The rider opens the website and search for the car of his choice and can find all the details of the car.</h5>
			<h4>Step 2 : Tried to books the car</h4>
			<h5 class="mb-5">Once the rider finds the right car, he completes his booking by scheduling the booking fon the date and the number of days. Rider would have an option to edit his booking until the driver take an action on the booking.</h5>
			<h4>Step 3 : After the booking is completed</h4>
			<h5 class="mb-5">After the booking is done from the rider end, a request will be sent to the driver with the booking details to accept or cancel the booking.</h5>
			<h4>Step 4 : Actions from the river end</h4>
			<h5 class="mb-5">Rider can see on the booking page if the order have been cancelled or accepted. If the order is accepted, the booking process is completed and the driver would arrive on the date form which the booking has been done.</h5>
			<h4>Step 5 : The driver takes the rider to the destination</h4>
			<h5 class="mb-5">The app gives the driver the option to access turn-by-turn directions, so the driver can focus on getting there and the rider can focus on enjoying a comfortable ride.</h5>
